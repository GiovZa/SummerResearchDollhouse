# SummerResearchDollhouse

Research conducted within Unity to create an open sourced project that can allow artists, writers, programmers, etc. to create content for VR. 
To see the poster presentation showcasing the results thus far, click on PumaStemDollhousePoster.png.

Note: This is a work-in-progress project that still has a lot more to still be fleshed out. It will take a few more years before the application is released for public use.
